A hands-on project demonstrating how phishing attacks are created, launched, and defended against using **Gophish** on **Kali Linux**.  
This lab focuses on understanding attacker techniques and reinforcing defensive strategies through real-world simulation.

## 🔍 What This Lab Covers
- Setting up phishing campaigns with Gophish  
- Crafting realistic phishing emails  
- Hosting credential-harvesting landing pages  
- Tracking campaign performance and victim interactions  
- Implementing defenses like filtering, MFA, and awareness training  

## 🛠 Tools Used
Kali Linux • Gophish • Web Server (Apache) • Email Account

## 🎯 Objective
To learn both sides of phishing—how attackers operate and how organizations can build strong human and technical defenses.

## ⚠️ Ethical Notice
This lab is for **authorized training, awareness, and educational purposes only**. Never use phishing tools without explicit permission.
